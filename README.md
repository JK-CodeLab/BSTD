## Introduction
The year is 2024. Barn animals have been bred, and kept captive for many years.
They have been used for food, clothing, and entertainment.
The animals have had enough, and have decided to revolt.
Their first target: your farm. You must defend your farm and protect it from the animals.
Set a path for the animals to travel on, place your towers, and defeat the endless waves of animals.
Good Luck!


## Overview
This is a tower defense game. The goal is to defeat all the enemies before they reach the end of the path. 
The player can place towers on the path to help defend the farm. Once ready, the player can press the start button to begin the level. 
As the level increases, the number of enemies spawned also increases, and the enemies spawn more frequently. 
If you would like to exit the game, you can save your game then leave. 
This will ensure that the next time you play, you'll be able to continue where you left off. 
If you die, you will be given the opportunity to start where you last saved your game. Be sure to save often!

## Controls
The game board is set up as a grid. The player can drag and drop any item they want from the shop menu. 
However, paths can only be placed adjacent to other paths. To start the level, the player must have made a valid path from the 
spawn point to the farmhouse.

To sell a tower or a path, the player must click on the sell button at the top of the screen to enter "Selling Mode". 
The player then can click on the tower or path they want to sell. Press the sell button again to exit "Selling Mode".

## Future Plans
Some exciting features are planned for the future:
- More variety of enemies (different speeds, different health, etc.)
- More variety of towers (different attack speeds, different attack ranges, etc.)
- Ability to upgrade towers
- Larger game board
